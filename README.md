## Features

### Board CRUD capabilty

A problem I faced was fetching the proper board to edit and without access to the ownProps match object. As a solution, I added an options key to the modal object. This key points to the board id to be updated or deleted. The board id is passed in at the board show page when the modal is opened as a second argument.
